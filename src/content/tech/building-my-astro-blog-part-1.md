Building a personal blog site has been on my list for a while now.  In a previous job, I used the \[Hugo](url="https://gohugo.io/"  target="_blank") site generator to build a static website for internal documentation. I recently got the itch to try actually building a site.  I did originally start with Hugo, but then somewhere along the line, I found [Astro](https://astro.build{target="_blank"})
