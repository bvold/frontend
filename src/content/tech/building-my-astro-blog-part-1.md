Building a personal blog site has been on my list for a while now.  In a previous job, I used the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site generator to build a static website for internal documentation. I recently got the itch to try actually building a site.  I actually started out using Hugo, but then I discovered [Astro](https://astro.build).
