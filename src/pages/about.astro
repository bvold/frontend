			<h3>About Me</h4>
			<p>
			Hello! I'm Bryan, a developer with an insatiable curiosity, always eager to dive deep into new projects and ideas. This blog is my space to not only document my thoughts and discoveries but also share them with the world. I stumbled upon Astro after initially learning about Hugo, and building this site became a thrilling adventure in itself. I wanted a platform where I could explore a variety of passions—from technology to photography, Bible prophecy, and language learning.

			<h4>My Journey into Development</h4>
			<p>
			My interest in computers began early on, thanks to a program for gifted and talented students at my elementary school. Although I didn’t necessarily see myself as gifted, school came easily to me, which sparked my curiosity. My small school had a MECC system teletype terminal connected to the Twin Cities, and that was my first taste of computing. In high school, I took my first computer science course, and from there, I was hooked.
			</p><br/>
			<h4>The First Language I Learned</h4>
			<p>
			The first language I learned was Commodore PET BASIC, and my first personal computer was a Commodore 64, which I purchased for $199 from Montgomery Wards. I went on to study computer science at the University of Minnesota, where one of my proudest achievements was writing a Unix shell that became the key solution for my professor’s class. Over the years, I’ve worked with various languages, including Pascal, Lisp, Smalltalk, C, and Rust.
			</p><br/>
			<h4>One of My Proudest Projects</h4>
			<p>
			One of my proudest projects is a phonetic spell checker I originally wrote in Java, which I recently converted to Rust with the help of AI tools. Exploring the use of AI in development has been another exciting part of my journey.
			<p><br/>
			<h4>Photography: From the Cosmos to the Petal</h4>
			<p>
			My love for photography likely stems from my childhood fascination with astronomy. I was always curious about both the very large and the very small—astronomy and atoms alike. One of my first cameras was a box camera I took to Bible camp, and I’ve been hooked ever since.
			</p><br/>
			<h4>Macro Photography</h4>
			<p>
			When digital cameras became mainstream, I delved into macro photography, using a Nikon Coolpix to capture intricate details of flowers. Today, I primarily use my Nikon D70S for nature photography, particularly focusing on sunsets, flowers, and the moon. John Shaw's nature photography books have been an inspiration for me, and I highly recommend his work to anyone interested in the field.
			</p><br/>
			<h4>A Passion for Bible Prophecy</h4>
			<p><br/>
			Around 2010, I experienced what I can only describe as an awakening, where I felt strongly that "We are in the end times." Since then, I’ve developed a deep interest in Bible prophecy, drawing insights from authors like Thomas Horn and teachers such as Steve Cioccolanti and Brandon Biggs. This has become an integral part of my life and something I often reflect on in my writing and thinking.
			</p><br/>
			<h4>Language Learning: A Lifelong Journey</h4>
			<p>
			My passion for languages started in high school with German, and it blossomed from there. I traveled to Germany with my German club during my freshman year, an experience that felt nothing short of magical. Since then, I’ve been on a language-learning adventure, studying everything from Russian and Turkish to French, Hebrew, and Hindi.			
			Right now, I’m focused on Russian, German, Turkish, and Yiddish, though I’ve dabbled in more than 20 languages to varying degrees. Duolingo has been a helpful tool, and I’ve also been inspired by my son’s language journey, particularly after he studied abroad in Costa Rica.
			<h4>Other Interests</h4>
			<p>
			Aside from tech, photography, and languages, I’ve always been passionate about astronomy, cosmology, and science in general. I’m particularly drawn to physics and chemistry, but I also have a deep interest in linguistics and English grammar. During my university years, I even joined the juggling club and spent hours perfecting my skills with clubs!
			</p><br/>
			<p>
			One of my greatest joys is helping others, especially those learning English. I discovered this passion while correcting English exercises on Busuu, and it’s something that continues to inspire me today.
			</p><br/>
			<h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
			<p>
			I tend to dive deeply into topics that catch my interest, and I’m always exploring new avenues. Recently, I discovered the concept of Ultralearning, which has piqued my interest in optimizing how I approach learning in all aspects of my life.
			</p><br/>
			<p></p>
			If I had to summarize my life and this blog in three words, it would be: Learn, Discover, Share. These are the principles that guide me, and I hope they resonate with you as you explore my blog.
